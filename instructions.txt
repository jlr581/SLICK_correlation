Instructions for the compilation and usage of the code for Roberts et al
(submitted), Integral correlation for uneven and differently sampled
data: Application to the Law Dome Antarctic climate record, Nature
Scientific Reports

Compilation (fortran source code version only)
===========
Makefiles are provided for both the intel ifort and gnu gfortran
compilers.  Type "make -f Makefile.ifort" or "make -f Makefile.gfortran"
to compile the text case example.

USAGE
=====
Fortran
-------
Run the code as per your operating system (for *unix operating systems
type ./example1).  The program will read in the 2 input text files
"test_series1.txt" and "test_series2.txt" and calculate the SLICK
correlation coefficient using the default scale parameter of 0.4.
Sample output is provided in the file "example1.out"

MATLAB
------
The MATLAB version is called as a function with the time series data
and optional scale parameter passed as arguments.

To run the test example for a *unix operating systems type
matlab example1.m

example output is given in "example1.out"

Python
------
The python version is using a python interpreter from the example1.py
script as:

python example1.py [-h]

Sample output is given in the file "example1.out"

Details of the arguments can be output using the -h option and outputs
the following below

Call the cslick correlation function as follows:
cslick=correlation(x1,y1,x2,y2,hc)
where (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are two differently and unevenly sampled series to be correlated, in this implementation these are numpy arrays. Optional argument hc (default=0.4) is a coefficient to tune  how closely data from the two series must be to be included in the calculation.
